# SingleServerQueue

Customers need service at a station for 0 to 5 minutes (service time) and they arrive every 0 to 8 minutes (interarrival time).
The program finds the average amount of time that the customer is in the system as well as the variance, and the average amount of time that the server is idle (and the variance).
The simulation is ran for 100,000 customers leaving the system and the output includes the service requirement clock times and the queue.
